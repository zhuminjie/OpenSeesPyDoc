Elastomeric Bearing (Plasticity) Element
========================================

This command is used to construct an elastomericBearing element object, which is defined by two nodes. The element can have zero length or the appropriate bearing height. The bearing has unidirectional (2D) or coupled (3D) plasticity properties for the shear deformations, and force-deformation behaviors defined by UniaxialMaterials in the remaining two (2D) or four (3D) directions. By default (sDratio = 0.5) P-Delta moments are equally distributed to the two end-nodes. To avoid the introduction of artificial viscous damping in the isolation system (sometimes referred to as "damping leakage in the isolation system"), the bearing element does not contribute to the Rayleigh damping by default. If the element has non-zero length, the local x-axis is determined from the nodal geometry unless the optional x-axis vector is specified in which case the nodal geometry is ignored and the user-defined orientation is utilized.

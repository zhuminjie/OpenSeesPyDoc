   .. note::

      If you use OpenSeesPy, I would like very much to hear from you. A short email to
      `zhum@oregonstate.edu <zhum@oregonstate.edu>`_
      describing who you are and how you use OpenSeesPy will mean a lot to me.
      I can justify spending time on improvements that I hope will benefit you.

   Please send any questions to `github issues <https://github.com/zhuminjie/OpenSeesPyDoc/issues>`_.

   Questions about the Mac version please ask `Stevan Gavrilovic <steva44@hotmail.com>`_.

   New :doc:`src/plotcmds` are developed by `Anurag Upadhyay <https://github.com/u-anurag>`_ from University of Utah.
   
   You are very welcome to contribute to OpenSeesPy with new command
   documents and examples

========================
 The OpenSeesPy Library
========================
`OpenSeesPy`_ is a `Python 3`_ interpreter of `OpenSees`_.
A minimum script is shown below:

::

   # import OpenSeesPy
   import openseespy.opensees as ops

   # wipe model
   ops.wipe()

   # create model
   ops.model('basic', '-ndm', 2, '-ndf', 3)
   

Most of `OpenSeesPy`_ commands have the same syntax and arguments as the
OpenSees `Tcl commands <http://opensees.berkeley.edu/wiki/index.php/Command_Manual>`_.
The conversion from Tcl to Python is easy and straightforward
as demonstrated with commands below.

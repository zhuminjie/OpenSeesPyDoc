 Plotting Commands
=======================

The source code is developed by `Anurag Upadhyay <https://github.com/u-anurag>`_ from University of Utah.

Model visualization is an ongoing development to make OpenSeesPy more user friendly.
It utilizes `Matplotlib 3.0 <https://matplotlib.org>`_ library to plot 2D and 3D models in a dedicated interactive window. You can use click-and-hold to change the view angle and zoom the plot. The model image can be saved with the desired orientation directly from the interactive plot window. If you did not install matplotlib using Anaconda, you will have to install PyQt or PySide to enable an interactive window (`Matplotlib Dependencies <https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html>`_).  

**Important**: To get an **interactive, inline** plot in a Jupyter notebook, use **%matplotlib notebook** to change the matplotlib backend before using plotting commands.

When using Spyder IDE and Jupyter notebook, the default setting is to produce a static, inline plot which is not
interactive. To change that, write the command **%matplotlib qt** in the Ipython console and then execute the model plotting commands. This will produce an interactive plot in a dedicated window.


See the example :doc:`ModelRendering` for a sample script.

Following elements are supported:

    * 2D and 3D Beam-Column Elements
    * 2D and 3D Quad Elements
    * 2D and 3D Tri Elements
    * 8 Node Brick Elements
    * Tetrahedron Elements (to be added)

The following two commands are needed to visualize the model, as shown below:

::

   #Change plot backend to Qt. ONLY if you are using an Ipython console (e.g. Spyder)
   %matplotlib qt
   
   #Change plot backend to 'Nbagg' if using in Jupyter notebook to get an interactive, inline plot.
   %matplotlib notebook
   
   # import OpenSeesPy rendering module
   from openseespy.postprocessing.Get_Rendering import *
   
   # render the model after defining all the nodes and elements
   plot_model()

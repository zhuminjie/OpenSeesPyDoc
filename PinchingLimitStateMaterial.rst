 Pinching Limit State Material
===============================

This command is used to construct a uniaxial material that simulates a pinched load-deformation response and exhibits degradation under cyclic loading. This material works with the RotationShearCurve limit surface that can monitor a key deformation and/or a key force in an associated frame element and trigger a degrading behavior in this material when a limiting value of the deformation and/or force are reached. The material can be used in two modes: 1) direct input mode, where pinching and damage parameters are directly input; and 2) calibrated mode for shear-critical concrete columns, where only key column properties are input for model to fully define pinching and damage parameters.
